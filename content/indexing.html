          Hi, this is <strong>Thunderbird Conversations</strong>!
        </p>
        <p>
          We've been trying to setup Thunderbird Conversations to give you the
          best experience, but you have so many messages that reindexing them
          would crash your Thunderbird.
        </p>
        <h2>The tl;dr version</h2>
        <p>
          If you have an insanely high amount of non-bugmail email, delete the
          <tt>global-message-db.sqlite</tt> file in your profile folder (see
          link below).
        </p>
        <h2>With more explanations</h2>
        <p>
          You're in one of the two situations below.
        </p>
        <p>
          Do you have a high amount of mail with attachments? Unless the first
          version of Thunderbird you ever tried is Thunderbird 3.3 alpha1 or
          later, these attachments won't show in the conversation view. We need
          to reindex all messages with attachments. The easiest way is for you
          to delete the <tt>global-messages-db.sqlite</tt> file in your profile
          folder.
        </p>
        <p>
          Are you a Mozillian? We have a nice special-case for Bugzilla emails,
          where we replace the sender, i.e. bugzilla-daemon@mozilla.org, with
          the value of X-Bugzilla-Who header. You probably have way too much
          bugmail, and we need to reindex all of it to enable that feature. If
          you can live with the feature being enabled for newly arrived bugmail
          only, just forget about this message. Otherwise, you'll want to delete
          the <tt>global-messages-db.sqlite</tt> file in your profile folder.
        </p>
