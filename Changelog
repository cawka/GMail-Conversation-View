--- Changes since 2.0alpha2 ---

- Improved conversations-in-separate-tabs: they now update automatically as new
messages arrive, and some inconsistencies between multiple copies of the same
conversation have been fixed.
- Support for phishing warnings.
- Support for Lightning notification bar, kudos to Philipp Kewisch!
- Support for spellchecking the quick reply. Use right-click to pick a language.
Will work only if using a recent Thunderbird (> 3.2).
- Quick reply improvements: now saves recipients, and doesn't lock the UI
anymore.
- UI support for extra contact actions (create filter, monospace from this
sender).
- UI support for junking a message (only available if there's just one message
in the conversation).
- Remove dotted outline on selected messages.
